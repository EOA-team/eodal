#E:earth_africa:dal Earth Observation Data Analysis Library
**A truely open-source package for unified analysis of Earth Observation (EO) data**

## About E:earth_africa:dal

E:earth_africa:dal is a Python library enabling the acquisition, organization, and analysis of Earth observation data in a completely open-source manner within a unified framework.

E:earth_africa:dal enables open-source, reproducible geo-spatial data science. At the same time, E:earth_africa:dal lowers the burden of data handling and provides access to **global satellite data archives** through **downloaders** and the fantastic **SpatioTemporalAssetsCatalogs** (STAC).

E:earth_africa:dal supports working in **cloud-environments** using [STAC catalogs](https://stacspec.org/) ("online" mode) and on **local premises** using a spatial PostgreSQL/PostGIS database to organize metadata ("offline" mode).

	abstract = {Earth Observation by means of remote sensing imagery and gridded environmental data opens tremendous opportunities for systematic capture, quantification and interpretation of plantâ€“environment interactions through space and time. The acquisition, maintenance and processing of these data sources, however, requires a unified software framework for efficient and scalable integrated spatio-temporal analysis taking away the burden of data and file handling from the user. Existing software products either cover only parts of these requirements, exhibit a high degree of complexity, or are closed-source, which limits reproducibility of research. With the open-source Python library EOdal (Earth Observation Data Analysis Library) we propose a novel software that enables the development of fully reproducible spatial data science chains through the strict use of open-source developments. Thanks to its modular design, EOdal enables advanced data warehousing especially for remote sensing data, sophisticated spatio-temporal analysis and intersection of different data sources, as well as nearly unlimited expandability through application programming interfaces (APIs).}
