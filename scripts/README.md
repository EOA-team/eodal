# README

This directory contains a more or less consolidated collection of scripts useful for our day-to-day work.
The scripts fuflil two purposes:

	a) they show how to E:earth_africa:dal
	b) they allow you to automate workflows such as keeping a local Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2 archive up-to-date or how to download PlanetScope data.
