## About E:earth_africa:dal

E:earth_africa:dal is a Python library enabling the acquisition, organization, and analysis of Earth observation data in a completely open-source manner within a unified framework.

E:earth_africa:dal enables open-source, reproducible geo-spatial data science. At the same time, E:earth_africa:dal lowers the burden of data handling and provides access to **global satellite data archives** through **downloaders** and the fantastic **SpatioTemporalAssetsCatalogs** (STAC).

E:earth_africa:dal supports working in **cloud-environments** using [STAC catalogs](https://stacspec.org/) ("online" mode) and on **local premises** using a spatial PostgreSQL/PostGIS database to organize metadata ("offline" mode).

	abstract = {Earth Observation by means of remote sensing imagery and gridded environmental data opens tremendous opportunities for systematic capture, quantification and interpretation of plantâ€“environment interactions through space and time. The acquisition, maintenance and processing of these data sources, however, requires a unified software framework for efficient and scalable integrated spatio-temporal analysis taking away the burden of data and file handling from the user. Existing software products either cover only parts of these requirements, exhibit a high degree of complexity, or are closed-source, which limits reproducibility of research. With the open-source Python library EOdal (Earth Observation Data Analysis Library) we propose a novel software that enables the development of fully reproducible spatial data science chains through the strict use of open-source developments. Thanks to its modular design, EOdal enables advanced data warehousing especially for remote sensing data, sophisticated spatio-temporal analysis and intersection of different data sources, as well as nearly unlimited expandability through application programming interfaces (APIs).}

## Data Model

![EOdal data model](img/EOdal_Data-Model.jpg)

E:earth_africa:dal has a sophisticated data model projecting the complexity of Earth Observation data into Python classes. The object-based design of E:earth_africa:dal has four base classes:

* [E:earth_africa:dal Band](eodal/core/band.py) is the class for handling single bands. A band is a two-dimensional raster layer (i.e., an two-dimensional array). Each raster cell takes a value. These values could represent color intensity, elevation above mean sea level, or temperature readings, to name just a few examples. A band has a name and an optional alias. Its raster grid cells are geo-referenced meaning each cell can be localized in a spatial reference system.
* [E:earth_africa:dal RasterCollection](eodal/core/raster.py) is a class that contains 0 to *n* Band objects. The bands are identified by their names or alias (if available).
* [E:earth_africa:dal Scene](eodal/core/raster.py) is essential a RasterCollection with `SceneMetadata` assigning the RasterCollection a time-stamp and an optional scene identifier.
* [E:earth_africa:dal SceneCollection](eodal/core/raster.py) is a collection of 0 to *n* Scenes. The scenes are identified by their timestamp or scene identifier (if available).

## Examples
We have compiled a set of [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/EOA-team/eodal_notebooks) showing you the capabilities of E:earth_africa:dal and how to unlock them.
