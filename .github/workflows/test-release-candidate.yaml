# Tests for releases and release candidates
#
# Runs on every tag creation, and all pushes and PRs to release branches
# named "v1.2.x", etc.
#
# This workflow is more extensive than the regular test workflow.
# - Tests are executed on more Python versions
# - Tests are run on more operating systems
# - N.B. There is no pip cache here to ensure runs are always against the
#   very latest versions of dependencies, even if this workflow ran recently.
#
# In addition, the package is built as a wheel on each OS/Python job, and these
# are stored as artifacts to use for your distribution process. There is an
# extra job (disabled by default) which can be enabled to push to Test PyPI.
